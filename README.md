# HACKATHON FE/BE COLLABORATIVE GROUP PROJECT 
(Theme - Shoe Store)
# PROJECT NAME: FeetFirst

# Project Overview
This application was designed to simulate a real-world scenario involving both the front-end and back-end teams to create a functioning shoe store website incorporating skills learned throughout the duration of their respective courses. The shoe store will simulate a real company's page complete with authenticated user sign-in/sign-out, product catalog and ability to generate and save cart and favorite items.

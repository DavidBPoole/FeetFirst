# Hackathon FE/BE Group Project (Theme - Shoe Store)

# Project/Store Name: FeetFirst

# Project Overview
This application was designed to simulate a real-world scenario involving both the front-end and back-end teams to create a functioning shoe store website incorporating skills learned throughout the duration of their respective courses. The shoe store will simulate a real-world request to build a company's webpage complete with authenticated user sign-in/sign-out, product catalog and the ability to generate and save or delete a user's cart and favorite items.
